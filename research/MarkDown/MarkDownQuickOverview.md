# Markdown Quick Overview
## Italic and Bold
* To make a phrase _italic_: use \_ tage
* To make a phrase **bold**: use ** tag

## Headers
Like HTML, Markdown has **six** types of headers, in decreasing sizes:
# This is header one
## This is header two
### This is header three
#### This is header four
##### This is header five
###### This is header six

## Links
There are two different link types in MD, but both of them render in the exact same way:
* Inline link: `[ ]` for link text, `( )` for link: `[Visit my Github](https://github.com/diaztran)` [Visit my Github](https://github.com/diaztran)
* Since we know the way to embed any link, we don't care about the second way :)

## Images
If we know how to create links in MD, we can create images to. The syntax is nearly the same.
The only difference between links and images is that images are prefaced with an exclamation point `( ! )`.

## Blockquotes
A blockquote is a sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader. Use use `( > )` to create a blockquote:
"Those who fall behind, get left behind."
> "Those who fall behind, get left behind."

## Lists
There are two types of lists in the known universe: unordered and ordered. That's a fanct way of saying that there are lists with bullet points, and list with numbers.

To create an unordered list, use preface `( * )`
* Ahri
* Violet
* Liliana
* Tel'annas

To create an ordered list, we use number as preface.
1. Ahri
2. Violet
3. Liliana
4. Tel'annas

## Paragraph
We inserting two spaces after each new line.
```
If the hero never comes to you..
If you need someone you're feeling blue..
If you wait for love and you're alone..
If you call your friends nobody's home..
```
Each dot `( . )` represents a space on the keyboard
